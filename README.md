# Autocorrect
NPL excercise1
In this assignment you will be training a language model to build a spell checker. Specifically, you will be implementing part of a noisy-channel model for spelling correction. We will give the likelihood term, or edit model, and your job is to make a language model, the prior distribution in the noisy channel model. At test time you will be given a sentence with exactly one typing error. We then select the correction which gets highest likelihood under the noisy-channel model, using your language model as the prior. Your language models will be evaluated for accuracy, the number of valid corrections, divided by the number of test sentences.
